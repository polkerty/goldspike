				<strong>Math Tip of the Day:</strong>
				<br/><br/>
				As you learn more and more formulas, focus on understanding them and how to derive the bigger ones from the littler
				ones; <em>don't</em> just memorize.

			<b>Math Tracks</b>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p>As a highschool student, you have four years to gain solid skills in Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry. 
			These courses lay important groundwork for college courses like Calculus, which is a prerequisite
			for training for nursing, engineering, computer science or IT, and many other jobs. If you don't take it by 
			your first year of college, you will severely limit your job choices and your potential future earnings. 
			Some of the following math tracks allow you to take Calculus in highschool, and others prepare you to take it
			right out of highschool. We will also discuss the main math courses you'll see in college if you
			major in engineering or another course with a lot of math.</p>
			
			<p>First of all, we have one important piece of advice: Start planning your math track as early as you can to 
			leave yourself a slack year. You may have to retake a course, or you may find in a few years that you want to do more 
			math  A good target year is Grade 7.</p>
			
			<p>Grade 7 is your first year in Junior High. </p>
